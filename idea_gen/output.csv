Context,Difficulty Meaning,"Can hit 10k+ users within 2-3 months provided that there's sufficient investment,Are purely engineering problems. You don't need to do any business development to get users. You will notice that pretty much all of these projects are utility apps.,Are buildable by any level of engineer, even the junior engineer who just learned to code over the past 3 months,Are at least fairly original and not sufficiently solved (i.e. I did several Google searches and couldn't find something good). You won't find any ""build a music app but better"" type ideas here.,Can be built for free or on an extremely low budget (<$10/month),Can be built on the side without taking over your day job,Are things I would build myself if I had the free time,Can be built in a variety of different ways, all adding different types of value. This means that all of these ideas can be brought to life by 5, 10, or 25 people, all putting their own compelling spin on it, v1 is buildable within 2 weeks, v1 buildable within 2-4 weeks, v1 buildable within 1 month+,Check out our YouTube series on how you can build and grow your apps to 500k+ users for free ,.,Sharing your project progress in the #side-projects channel of our Slack community ,. Please @mention me and ,!,Sharing your progress on your personal LinkedIn! We would love to make side projects more mainstream, and sharing your progress in a public setting is a great way to do that. I personally feel like it would be amazing to see a #100daysofcode challenge but for a side project instead of the usual tutorial and course following I usually see on LinkedIn. Rahul, the ,, and myself would love to be @mentioned on these posts as well!"
